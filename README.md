pyusb-scale
===========

Wrote this for the purpose of interfacing with a Mettler-Toledo PS60 scale, but it should work for any other scale that supports the "Universal Serial Bus HID Point of Sale Usage Tables."

Requires [PyUSB](https://github.com/walac/pyusb).

Run tests from the project root with [unittest2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2):
